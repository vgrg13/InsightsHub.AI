# What is InsightsHub.AI?

InsightsHub.AI is a platform for restaurants to improve business performance through data driven decisions. It leverages business intelligence (BI) capability to generate deep insights on order data collected through point-of-sale terminals like ToastTab, Square, etc. We continue to add features like customer sentiment analyzer and sales forecasting leveraging various AI techniques including Natural Language Processing (NLP).

This code uses NLP algos to assess the sentiment of customer reviews and provide insights to the restaurants to be able to improve their customer service.

# How does the product work?
**End-to-end steps** below starting with data upload to report generation:
>1. Client uploads order history and item files securely through InsightsHub.AI using their account (2 years history stored by POS terminal, and needed for seasonal trends)

>2. Files stored in a database, provided as a service from go-daddy

>3. Files are concatenated in Microsoft Excel (just stacking each monthly file - separately for order level (#1) and order item level (#2) files)

>4. Google reviews are sourced through an online bot (https://botster.io/bots/google-maps-reviews-scraper)

>5. Developed machine learnings (ML) codes provide reasons of negative and positive sentiments (#3)

>6. 3 files are input to a pre-built Tableau with over 30 preconfigured views and provide instant insights (links below)

>7. The report is shared with client including recommendations to generate concrete actions for improvements

>8. Business Intelligence and ML insights provide deep insights into their business as reported by our clients

# What Insights are provided by our platform?
**Business Intelligence**
* Sales Volume Trends and seasonal behavior
* Sales trends across Dining options (Lunch/Dinner, etc.) and Order sources (website, GrubHub, etc.) among other dimensions
* Menu items performance, items sales affinity to build creative combos
* Staffing recommendations based on dine-in traffic
* Promotion recommendations to boost sales especially on days with low traffic
* Take out patterns and food pre-preparation recommendations to process customer orders faster

**Insights based on Natural Language Artificial Intelligence/ML Model**
* Rate of Negative sentiments
* Topics of Negative Reviews

All insights, their interpretations, and recommendations are provided through Tableau views. A couple of screenshots below for reference

# How did I build this solution?

Most restaurants lack understanding of basic trends in their business, such as monthly sales performance, take-out vs. delivery vs dine-in traffic by day/hour, or when to run promotions. Descriptive analysis using BI tools provides significant insights to businesses revealing previously unknown patterns. In addition, for certain problems, Artificial Intelligence is an extremely useful tool to unearth trends. As an example, identifying the topics your customers are most dis-satisfied with require use of sophisticated Natural Language Processing AI/ML techniques.

I used Tableau to build a host of pre-configured views applicable to restaurants, and custom views are created as needed. I chose Tableau over other tools based on its ability to generate quality dashboards and its flexibility to create new fields using custom SQL. This Udemy course (https://www.udemy.com/course/tableau10/) was one of my sources to learn Tableau in detail along with youtube videos and the tableau community (https://community.tableau.com/s/)

For my first AI use case, which required analyzing customer online reviews, I worked upon building models using Natural Language processing (a branch of machine learning for text analysis). I supplemented my data science skills through a number of online resources. As an example, I found the Youtube Playlist from Krish Naik (Senior Data Scientist with 10+ years of experience and cofounder of iNeuron.ai) very useful to understand the concept of different techniques. 

Online resource examples:
- NLP Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZoTAELRMXVMdJ5sqbCK2LiM0HhQVWNzm
- One of the NLP articles: https://towardsdatascience.com/sentiment-classification-in-python-da31833da01b

**Machine Learning + NLP Models**
>Codes are written in python
* Customer Review Sentiment Analysis to find out Rate of Negative Sentiments: https://github.com/vgrg13/InsightsHub.AI/blob/main/Restaurant_Reviews_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb

* Topics of Negative Reviews: https://github.com/vgrg13/InsightsHub.AI/blob/main/Restaurant%20Reviews%20Topic%20Modeling.ipynb
>Over 10 different libraries are used including vaderSentiment, SentimentIntensityAnalyzer, textblob, gensim, pyLDAvis, pandas, numpy, nltk, re, sklearn, and matplotlib

**Key use cases: insights provided through order history data analysis**
- Staffing Needs by day/hour/week/month
- Marketing promotions optimization and sales growth 
- Menu optimization (by seasons)
- Customer Reviews sentiment trends and root causes of negative sentiments
- Order channel performance and support to increase website orders



**Tableau Dashboards supporting above use cases**

8 distinct dashboards are built with 30+ different charts followed by Executive Summary Dashboard. Details below
* **1) Sales Trends**: Monthly/Seasonal sales trends, sales distribution by order channel, meal type and other dimensions
* **2) Year-over-year Sales Trends**: Performance compared to last year across months and seasons
* **3) Order Source Trends**: Dine in vs. delivery vs. take out comparison and trends by order channel (DoorDash, Grubhub, etc.)
* **4) Meal Type Trends**: Dinner vs. lunch vs. breakfast comparison across months and year-over-year
* **5) Menu Items Trends**: Menu items sales performance at 3 levels: menu groups (appetizer, entr√©e, etc.), menu subgroup (veg vs non-veg appetizers, salads vs soups, etc.) and at the menu item level (french fries, etc.)
* **6) Order Trends Summary**: Order scorecard including interesting dimensions like avg. order size, % beverage sales, % gratuity/tip paid, etc.
* **7) Marketing Promotions and Staffing Optimization**: Sales trends on different days and recommendations for promotions to increase traffic
* **8) Top Customer Complaints**: Negative and positive reviews distribution, topics of negative reviews and ability to read reviews

# Our Future Roadmap

We want to include a number of other data sources to continue to unearth insights into topics important for restaurants
* **Optimize your menu** for profitability and reduction in food wastage: Need inventory and supplier purchase history data
* **Increase website orders** to avoid fees from 3rd party apps and increase price attractivness for customers: Need google analytics data
* **Customer segmentation** to identify loyal customers and increase engagement: customer data (phone no, address, card #, etc.) to link orders and customers
* **Root causes of delivery delays and insufficient staffing** scenarios: Collect staffing data and delivery timestamps 
* **Impact of price increase** on customer behavior: Collect pricing change data
* **Impact of external factors** on business: Collect Macro-economics trends (e.g., high unemployment rate or covid infection rate) and local demographics data
