7,7,"We visited the Burger Co. for the first time and it was ok. I was expecting a bit more when visiting this location after reading the reviews. The location is small with a nostalgic design which was nice. There was no music playing just quiet. As it was our first time we just ordered a bacon cheeseburger with fries. The cashier staff was not the friendliest just took our order and that was it. There was no greeting or suggestion what is good on the menu. After waiting about 5 minutes we received our burgers and fries in a bag. The burger looked fresh with good meat but after the first bite there was really no flavor. The bacon was really good but that was it. I like that the meat patty looked better than most burgers (like a five guys/shake shak) but was really missing flavor. The fries are steak fries which had a little bit of seasoning on them. Four stars is generous for this location, but, maybe it was just an off day.",Positive,0.2506944444444444,3.0,"burger, burgers, fry, good, great, like, nice, bacon, rare, delicious",21-Jun

It is not.I had build your own burger. Ingredients not fresh. Canned slice of pineapple. Bacon clearly cooked much earlier in day. Very skimpy on Hawaiian sauce. The chicken was tender, so that's something. Fries are really good. My kids had chicken fingers. They were happy. Only reason I give 3 stars and not 2, it was fast.

Got the Bacon Co special with American cheese, and bacon cheese fries and a soda (actually got an ice tea)b Asked for rare got medium, and a little dry.and cheese fries were a little too salt and ( and although this may be a petty item) while there was plenty of bacon, the bits were too large should have been broken up a little more. Girlfriend got the Philly cheese steak. (No mushrooms thank you) and sweet potato fries(+$1.) and a Stewart's Root Beer. She loved the cheesesteak ( she wished there was more juice) as for my Opinion with my bacon burger not so thrilled. But I will probably give it another try, cause I'm interested in the lamb burger, and if I get another burger I will stress rare like blood, rare just knock the horns off grind it up, and give it a passing Acquaintance with the grill, just enough to warm it up and throw it on a bun. Rare, not medium rare, definitely not medium. Rare. So anyway for a eleven dollar Hamburger I found it lacking that certain something that Je ne sais quoi. Like an epic burger. It missed the mark.

Meh... robot at best. Appearance: I can see some effort. There were a few items on the shelves that were interesting and even some even for customer's entertainment. Food: (by the way we got burgers at the place whose name boasted the product.) The burgers were not terrible, and there are good add-ons, but certainly nothing to recommend highly.

Took less than 10 minutes to get burger but it was overcooked and very dry - opposite of medium rare. The fries were very crispy but greasy. The milkshake was a vanilla shake with chocolate syrup poured in and not fully blended so it tasted like vanilla shake except when the chocolate syrup came up through the straw!
