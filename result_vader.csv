I've frequented CBC many times and not once was it anything but spectacular. Dave, you are doing a bang-up job running a tough niche business during even tougher times. We love you. With or without onions. Be in to see you, soon.",Positive
1,0.5994,Spicy burger is amazing. Huge burgers cooked to order with POTATO BREAD. I wish sauce came with the fried raviolis but now I know to ask next time:),Positive

3,0.952,"Don't be fooled by the lack of atmosphere. The interior is dirty and looks like a college dorm. The signage done by a middle school art student with a stencil and the customer service doesn't exist. There are interior and exterior tables but service does not exist. This place is strictly take out. However .... The burgers were delicious and the onion rings were great. If you want a nice place to eat , skip this place. But if you want a burger in a bag to go , this place will suffice.",Positive
4,0.9186,I happened to stumble upon this place last year. I remember it was the best burger I had in Jersey. I revisited the place and got a cheesesteak and a burger. Both were delicious and the services was great. All at a reasonable price. Will be back.,Positive

8,0.9435,"We visited the Burger Co. for the first time and it was ok. I was expecting a bit more when visiting this location after reading the reviews. The location is small with a nostalgic design which was nice. There was no music playing just quiet. As it was our first time we just ordered a bacon cheeseburger with fries. The cashier staff was not the friendliest just took our order and that was it. There was no greeting or suggestion what is good on the menu. After waiting about 5 minutes we received our burgers and fries in a bag. The burger looked fresh with good meat but after the first bite there was really no flavor. The bacon was really good but that was it. I like that the meat patty looked better than most burgers (like a five guys/shake shak) but was really missing flavor. The fries are steak fries which had a little bit of seasoning on them. Four stars is generous for this location, but, maybe it was just an off day.",Positive
9,0.8271,Wish I found this place sooner. Great burgers and cajun fries. Worth every cent,Positive

14,0.9747,Burgers were good- ordered a build your own and a texas burger. Were pretty cold when we got it home but I'm sure would be even better as a sit in or dine outside. Were a great size and juicy. Largeamount of fries for the price and burgers were a good size. Will definitely be back.,Positive
15,0.9199,Had a super yummy burger and my first fried ravioli experience here. Definitely recommend!!,Positive
16,-0.5773,"First time going here since it's changed ownership. Cashier was not helpful or welcoming, inside was freezing cold. Got the Texas burger, cheap potato bun and burgers were very dry and tasted like low quality meat. Must of been frozen.",Negative
17,0.7013,"Place was freezing and service was bad. My burger might have been hot at one point, but the ice cold frozen tomato's and lettuce that chilled my teeth when I bit into them, may have made my burger barely warm. Onion rings and fries were way under seasoned and super oily. Owner need to go in there and try his own food.",Positive
18,-0.6381,"We got the wrong food and then get gave us back the minimal toppings that were asked for, only having enough for the very center. The people in the back there very loud and didn't seem like they were very work oriented and the food showed that.",Negative
19,0.8445,"I stopped by at the Clinton location in Nov-2020. The menu looked interesting so ordered a portobello burger. To my surprise, it came with cold, dry mushrooms (like store bought, dry mushrooms in a bag), slapped with toppings. After first byte, I told the guy at the counter. He acted surprised and promised to replace with a lamb burger (it was at the same price). When second order came, it was again mushroom but this time it was portobello vegetable topped with cold iceberg lettuce, stale tomato slices and other toppings. There was not even a burger patty! I have never had anything worse than this until today. Throw your money down the drain rather than eating at this place ever!!",Positive
20,0.9398,"My wife and I ordered for first time today while we are both working from home and the food was great!  Even for take out the burgers, fries and onion rings all tasted fantastic and proportions were more than generous.  Highly recommend if you live in area or are just visiting.  Already looking forward to next time!",Positive

22,0.9732,"The current ownership has raised the bar extremely high as to both food quality and service! During the pandemic, they have graciously delivered the food to my car, something other eateries in Clinton and Annandale should more readily do! The onion rings are incredibly good. Cheesesteaks and eggplant parm are top notch and the rolls are outstanding! My wife enjoys building her own burger and enjoys both their beef and turkey patties. This is a not to miss establishment in Clinton!l In fact, we hope to order lunch their today!!",Positive
23,0.8193,"Im not saying you have to come for a well cooked, awesome tasting burger but Im saying you should. Ive also had some good Mac & cheese bites but these ones will blow you away! If I could give a 12 star rating I totally would!",Positive
24,-0.3182,over priced mediocre burger..waste of money. cheese over $1 more to add to your burger.also flies were roaming around inside the restaurant. after reading other reviews i see this was an issue before and they havent bothered to fix it,Negative
25,-0.6486,"Tried for the first time. Burgers were ample size and fries and onion rings were excellent. No soda fountain but a fridge case with a variety of bottles. The cashier/ order taker came out to clean tables and didn't check on us to see how we were doing. If she did, I would have told her about the horrendous gnat problem coming from the garbage/ recycling receptacles. I would go back, hoping the gnat problem was fixed.",Negative
26,0.8576,Very good burger. Had the Clinton Bs burger which had a little kick (spicy) due to jalapeños. Was very tasty and well priced. Would try the place again. Sorry my photo isnt the best.,Positive

29,-0.7845,"My boyfriend and I went in, places our order (Mediterranean Burger and California Burger, each with fries and a drink) and decided that we would sit outside. Upon setting our things down on the table outside, we noticed about three flies in the inside window buzzing around, and the tables were dirty. It was just disgusting. The waitress was dressed vulgar and the host who took our order had a horrible attitude. We got our food and ate in the car; the burgers were good.",Negative
30,0.6705,Food cooked fresh and friendly service.,Positive
31,0.2023,"I guess its fair to say, that you should order burgers from this place. nothing else. Just ordered a panini, which was a bunch of stuff cooked on a griddle, then loosely placed in between 2 halfs of a pita bread. Its edible, thats about it. The chicken was all dry and over cooked. I cook better at home than this.",Positive
32,0.9641,Great burger! And it was huge!!! Had burger with chorizo. Spent last 16 years in SoCal so I know the taste of good chorizo. This burger was great. Also ordered fries - hot and tasty. Highly recommend and will definitely be back!!,Positive

34,0.9127,"Ok food, poor customer service, no working restroom (occurring problem if you read other reviews) I would find somewhere else to spend your money. It's ok. Everything was fresh & hot when we got it. Nothing to brag about.Walked in for first time, nobody at counter. Do it yourself dirty touchscreen in Covid conditions is poor choice. Waited for young man to come to counter. He said nothing. Just stared at us. No greeting of any kind at all. We are not local. Maybe for locals by comparison this is good burger place. It is not.I had build your own burger. Ingredients not fresh. Canned slice of pineapple. Bacon clearly cooked much earlier in day. Very skimpy on Hawaiian sauce. The chicken was tender, so that's something. Fries are really good. My kids had chicken fingers. They were happy. Only reason I give 3 stars and not 2, it was fast. But the same pleasant young man who didn't greet us, literally walked out to hand us bag of food, once again said NOTHING. Rude.",Positive
35,-0.0775,"Just ordered dinner via door dash. Sweet potato fries ($5.00!) were undercooked soggy and cold. Burgers weren't very tasty. I thought that a place with burger In Their name would have outstanding burgers. Very bland and my fries and onion rings tasted like disappointment. Always trying to eat at the local places, especially now, but they didn't impress me.",Negative
36,0.631,"For a place that specializes in burgers it was really mediocre. The bun was stale and too big for the size of the burger, they messed up the burger with the wrong cheese, and the meat was only ok. I ordered the regular french fries and got fries that had some kind of cajun seasoning on them. Milkshake was pretty good, but that's about the only good thing I can say.",Positive

We ordered a well done Clinton""B's"" burger along with other items. The burger was cold and extremely rare. Did not go back because we hardly go out to public places. The rest was ok.",Positive

43,0.8436,"good burger! nice service, though the self serve machine was not working the staff was very helpful",Positive
44,0.9845,"This is one of my favorite places in the area to get a burger. The burgers are delicious, all of the ingredients taste like they are high quality. I'm a fan of anything with bacon on it, and I love the bacon they use, it's cooked perfectly to a give it a nice crisp. Also, the thick cut french fries are amazing. Staff is very friendly. Overall I've never had a bad experience here, and always look forward to going.",Positive
45,0.746,Been here a few times and it's good but nothing really fantastic that makes me want to come back. Good but pretty average.,Positive

47,-0.3865,"I'm not sure why this place has such good reviews, the place is average at best! First of all the guy is very rude. If you ask a question, he walks away from you and does not come back! The table I was sitting at was very sticky. I put napkins down to cover the sticky stuff and the napkins became glued to the table! The food prices are expensive! $8 hamburger and $5 for a small size powdered milk shake! The bathroom was out of order. No catch-up bottles on the table and we ran out of napkins. Whenever a customer opens the door, freezing cold air cools down the small eating area. Parking is on the street or in the cominled lot behind the building. Next time I'll pass on this place and go to McDonald's!",Negative
48,0.9721,"I arrive at this outstanding restaurant once a month since I like the good air that is outline this place. The personel is highly helpful and qualified. The service is awfully rapid. Also, the food they cook is first-rate. I came many times and I was always pleased. The rate is fair. I recommend this place to all my friends.",Positive
49,0.7264,I had the lamb burger served on a large kaiser roll with lettuce and sauteed onions. Cant get lamb very many places. It was very good. For $7 it was even better.,Positive

54,0.9606,"First time visiting Burger Co. long wait for the burgers, but as they say good food takes time, eh. Ordered off the daily special board. Got the Bacon Co special with American cheese, and bacon cheese fries and a soda (actually got an ice tea)b Asked for rare got medium, and a little dry.and cheese fries were a little too salt and ( and although this may be a petty item) while there was plenty of bacon, the bits were too large should have been broken up a little more. Girlfriend got the Philly cheese steak. (No mushrooms thank you) and sweet potato fries(+$1.) and a Stewart's Root Beer. She loved the cheesesteak ( she wished there was more juice) as for my Opinion with my bacon burger not so thrilled. But I will probably give it another try, cause I'm interested in the lamb burger, and if I get another burger I will stress rare like blood, rare just knock the horns off grind it up, and give it a passing Acquaintance with the grill, just enough to warm it up and throw it on a bun. Rare, not medium rare, definitely not medium. Rare. So anyway for a eleven dollar Hamburger I found it lacking that certain something that Je ne sais quoi. Like an epic burger. It missed the mark. Close but that only counts with claymores.",Positive
55,0.9392,"Delicious! A great selection of burgers and sides, as well as a build your own. It is a BYO place if you want a cold one to go with your burger. We enjoyed playing the games while waiting for our food (which wasnt a long time).",Positive
56,0.9286,"Philly Cheese burgers and wings were great! Food was hot, fresh and flavorful. Onion rings had too much batter but the rest of the food was great. We will definitely eat here again if we are in the area again.",Positive
57,0.8169,Sooo many choices of burgers! I had the lamb burger with feta which I've never had before. It was cooked to order and delicious. Service is very friendly.,Positive
58,0.9549,"Honestly, I didn't have high hopes. I stumbled across the place and I went in at an off time, and there was only 1 person in the place. There is no table service -- you order at a kiosk at the window (it was not working so someone took my order). Ordered a regular cheeseburger. Oh. My. Goodness. One of the best burgers I've had in years. For those familiar with Krug's Tavern, these are just as good but less greasy. Fresh beef, nice soft bun, and it was incredible. There are lots of roll/bread options from which to choose, as well as various protein options if you want something other than beef. This is definitely going to become a regular for me!",Positive
59,0.9633,Hands down the best burger in the area. Had an awesome time enjoying at this cute vibe place. Will definitely recommend trying their burger combo.,Positive

62,0.9622,"Amazing burgers! The meat tastes fresh, the bun bread is soft and flavor. If you're looking for a classic American burger of top quality this is the place to go. I had the texan burger and was well balanced in flavor. Definitely one of the best burgers I've had in a long time. The fries were also very good. Crispy and not overly seasoned. It's a bigger burger than the average size so to curb your burger craving head here!",Positive
63,0.479,"Okay, so we were in the attractive town of Clinton and hungry... Aimed at Cracker Barrel we decided to take a look around. Upon seeing the exterior of this particular burger joint, we decided it might be the place to go. From there it was southbound. Service: oh you mean the dude glued to his cell phone. Meh... robot at best. Appearance: I can see some effort. There were a few items on the shelves that were interesting and even some even for customer's entertainment. Food: (by the way we got burgers at the place whose name boasted the product.) The burgers were not terrible, and there are good add-ons, but certainly nothing to recommend highly. Shake was not good. Price: way too expensive for the value. You are not 5 guys at all. Final: Might've been the right place... But it must've been the wrong time... try for yourself.",Positive

70,-0.4842,Went for the first time this past Friday and would not go back. There was garbage on the floor and trash can overflowing. My daughter went into use the bathroom the toilet was not working. Felt bad for the guy behind the counter as there was a line of people waiting to order and he was also charged with running out the food. A management mess. On top of it all the burgers and fries were very average. Was excited to try this place out but was disappointed.,Negative
71,0.876,"BEST BURGERS, Great taste",Positive
72,0.9468,Great selection of yummy burgers. You can go with signature recipes or customize your own. Fast friendly service and good prices.

74,0.9859,"Been back a few times and really like this place! Fresh, great tasting burgers, yummy shakes and really friendly service. The games are a fun addition if you want to extend your night a bit too. Checked out the new burger place in Clinton and think it's a great addition to the area. Reasonably priced, appropriate wait time for cook to order food, generous portions and both the burgers and the cheesesteak were great...I was perfect for a quick dinner.",Positive
75,0.926,"Big burgers, great staff, and best fries in town. Definitely recommend.",Positive
76,0.5618,"Not good, but not bad. It's pretty mediocre. However, it could just be because I ordered the veggie burger. It was all tasteless, but $9 for a burger, fries, and drink is a good deal for the area. It just all desperately needs seasoning. Even the fries need salt. However, what bothered me most was that all of the tables and napkin holders felt like they were covered in grease. Worse, the owner was trying too hard to get business. After thoroughly explaining the menu to me, he then proceeded to approach me multiple times while eating to check in and at one point approach every table to hand out menus to take to go and again explain the different types of burgers. Checking in once is fine, but to repeatedly approach every table to try to sell your food is just weird and annoying--especially when we've clearly already bought something.",Positive
77,0.9488,Awesome atmosphere Plus the food is just awesome! I haven't had a bad meal there yet! Definitely five-star place. :-),Positive

83,0.8402,"Burgers are a thing of beauty. Clinton Burger Co. Cooks them to order and builds them to your specifications. You can even add to the specialty burgers. Add a side of ample fries or onion rings, made with red onions and you have quite possibly made one of the best burger experience decisions ever",Positive
84,0.919,"Great little spot! I like that they have a takeout stand and it's a casual spot for a quick burger and fries. I wish they did a better job about looking open, as I've driven by so many times and it looked closed.",Positive
85,0.8126,"I had the Texas burger, rare. Love that you can order the way you like it and it was rare, juicy and full of flavor.My friend had the clinton burger, also rare and his was a LITTLE overcooked, but by much. He said B+, had it been rare A for sure.",Positive
86,0.867,"Went for lunch and ordered burger with blue cheese and mushrooms, fries, and ablack & white shake. Sounded like it should be good. Cashier asked how I wanted the burger cooked, which was a good sign. I said medium rare and the girl at the register repeated it. She said she would bring the burger to me outside when it was ready. Took less than 10 minutes to get burger but it was overcooked and very dry - opposite of medium rare. The fries were very crispy but greasy. The milkshake was a vanilla shake with chocolate syrup poured in and not fully blended so it tasted like vanilla shake except when the chocolate syrup came up through the straw! The waiter did not give me napkins so I had to go back in to get napkins. For $15.00, should be much better.",Positive

90,0.9705,My first experience at CBC was terrific. I can honestly say I had one of the best burgers I've had in a long time. And I do enjoy the occasional burger. The burger was cooked to perfection with plenty of flavor. Awesome fries!,Positive
91,-0.101,Sadly after eating here a couple of times I will not be returning. I have ordered a turkey burger several times. Well today I get my burger and it is beef. I kindly go back in to tell them of the mistake and they insist the patty is beef. I think a 5 year old can tell the difference between a turkey patty and a beef patty. What happen to customer is right and making a new burger? Very sad too because the other times their TURKEY burger was good. 5 thumbs down.,Negative
92,0.9542,"Fast service, great food! Went here on a Saturday when they were super busy. I had my food within 10 minutes. The man who waited on us was extremely polite and helpful! He even walked around to every table to make sure the orders were correct and that we were enjoying our food.",Positive
93,0.9702,"These burgers are amazing. They taste just like my grandfather used to make. The buns are so delicious and everything is made fresh to order. This place is a great addition to Clinton. I get a different burger each time I go but my favorite is the Deluxe burger or the Bacon burger... Onion rings here are yummy. What a gem. The tables here could use cleaning more often but I see they only have a few staff members that are always friendly and working hard, especially the young lady with glasses at the register... These are the most juicy and tasty burgers in Clinton... If you don't believe me go see for yourself...",Positive

95,0.9098,"Mixed bag. The good: the burger was great! Good texture, cooked to spec and super juicy. Fries were generously portioned. Board games available. The bad: milkshake was bizarre - possibly chocolate milk blended with ice? Watery and big ice chunks. Ambiance is so-so. No music and hard walls means conversations can be heard throughout (I can hear the people on the other side, the chef can hear me, etc.) I think we will order out next time if we come again :)",Positive

102,0.9325,"Cute and quaint looking from the outside. The inside is basic. It's BYOB, which is cool if you're wanting to have some beer with your burger. We sat at one of the 2 bistro tables outside. You can build your own burger: bread, patty, toppings, condiments. I like the variety of burgers: plant based, salmon, poultry, and beef. The veggie burger was good. I got it with lettuce, tomato , red onion, pickles + mayo and sriracha sauce. The French fries were crispy and delicious. Overall, it's a solid spot. I'd go back.",Positive
103,0.9595,"I think this place is a great addition to downtown Clinton. The new owners have kept the original menu and have expanded it and there is great food at very reasonable prices. Some of my personal recommendations would include the italian sandwiches (eggplant is excellent) , the Chili (or chili dogs) and of course the burgers. I had the Mexican Red a few weeks ago, which has a meat blend of beef and chorizo. Very delicious.",Positive

106,0.9662,"We ordered two chicken paninis and sides. So the ingredients inside are pretty good but they use a super thin panini ""bread"" that's more like a thin pita. The ""bread"" was my not even warm and the moz that should have been in the sandwich, looked liked a tiny bit fall inside my mistake. The bottom ""bread"" was completely soggy. The fries have a light coating and taste ok but cut too thick for my liking. Cheese fries are ok, they use a cheese whiz of some kind, I don't like cheese whiz. The best thing I had was the onion rings, a corn meal blend coating. One star because we got chicken and vegetables, not a grilled chicken panini with cheese. Won't be eating here again.",Positive

110,0.8976,I was surprised to read negative reviews. I have twice ordered from the Clinton Burger Company and both times was very pleased. The price was reasonable and lower than if I went to MacDonald's. The California Cheeseburger was delicious. I liked the fries and onion rings that came with the burger. The service was very friendly and professional. I will definitely go back.,Positive
111,0.8658,"If you are ever in Clinton stop by Burger Company. Their burgers were great and beat out 5 guys as my local burger place. Definitely try the onion rings, they were crunchy and went great with the California burger.",Positive
112,-0.2247,This place changed hands for the 3rd time. I had the overpriced hamburger and it was too thick and tasteless. The coleslaw that came with it had a strange taste and threw it out. When it was Johnny's I preferred their burger better. I can't comment on their other foods on the menu but I was not a fan of the price and the burger.,Negative
113,0.9471,My husband and I grabbed a quick bite after a hike. Truly delicious food. My husband had a cheeseburger and helped me finish my sausage and pepper sandwich which was HUGE and very tasty. We will definitely be back. Great little place.,Positive
114,0.416,"Wife ordered a black bean burger, which are definitely grocery store frozen, not fresh. Cheap buns, my mushroom burger crumbled to pieces in my hands as soon as I picked it up. Definitely not worth the price.",Positive
115,0.9509,Fun little Hamburger Joint with lots of other fresh made options. Fresh Ground Burgers for sure. Real Potato Fries. Super Shakes. We are heading back next week for the Italian Hot Dogs and Sausage and Peppers becuse they looked amazing when the server brought them over to the next table from ours.,Positive

119,0.8271,"Stopped in for lunch. Burger, onion rings, eggplant parmigiana sandwich, and grilled chicken salad were all excellent. Service was prompt and friendly. We will definitely return next time we are in Clinton.",Positive
120,0.9725,"My first experience at Johnny's Place was actually at the 2017 Clinton Fire Chili Cook off! It was also the restaurant I wound up voting for AND they even won! Recently, we decided to stop in and try the full menu. My kids and I shared a couple of cheeseburgers with a large order of fries, while my husband opted for the sausage and peppers. The burgers were super juicy and cooked just the way I like them. The fries were probably the highlight for me - they were seasoned with a unique mix and fried up to perfection. The restaurant itself is very casual and the owner was very friendly. I would definitely come back again!",Positive
121,0.9725,"This place makes delicious tasting burgers its simple. The service is always fast as I do frequent the place enough to know. Its got a great grove for any age crowd and you can sit outside also, front or back. The fries are chunky and crispy good. The onion rings have onions in them!! He offers burger specials and a nice selection of Italian specials also. Eggplant, sausage and peppers and Italian hot dogs. My burger was the Italiano special that had beautiful tasting portabella mushrooms, red peppers and cheese. Really a good combination and just enough. Or just get a thick shake. C'mon already, get over there or I'm taking your seat.",Positive
122,0.7959,The burgers and fries are amazing! The food always comes out quickly never a long wait. By far my favorite place to grab a burger in clinton.,Positive
123,0.9659,"Mouth watering burgers, the service by Danielle and chef Johnny was superb! Extremely accommodating and friendly. The place is very cozy and well kept, enjoyed the chocolate milkshake and turkey burger. Fries were perfectly crispy, the place is very local not too far from rt 22, this is a gem in Clinton! If you want a mouth watering burger you must visit Johnny's Place. They have seafood Wednesday's as well, seems to be very popular amongst some of the locals. If you are in the area craving a burger stop and have a shake, burger and fries you will not regret it :)",Positive
124,0.9295,"First time here. Came here after vending at a local event with my gf. Short of no description of what a Scotty G's burger is on the menu; all was great! We had juicy delicious cheeseburgers with crispy, yet full of potato fries! Yummy!!! Plenty of choices for drinks. Very cool little throwback joint.",Positive
125,0.9686,"We love this restaurant, and can walk there from our house. Last night we had the student special, which includes either a hamburger or cheeseburger, an ample supply of absolutely delicious fries, and a can of soda for $7. They also serve fantastic shakes, and various types of hamburgers, hot dogs, and other meats. You can eat inside or out on the patio. The food is ready quickly, and tastes awesome.",Positive
126,-0.6852,"Ordered a hamburger and fries, was meh. The owner is rude, and the service was non-existent. Kinda hard to mess up a burger and fries.",Negative
127,0.9937,"Hands-down best burger and fries I've had in Hunterdon -- right downtown in Clinton. (Til now it was 5 Guys in Flemington, but I'm a convert, and I'm picky about my burgers.) Fresh, hand-shaped burgers grilled to order, crusty on the outside, juicy on the inside. Grilling a burger like that is no small feat. And Johnny's fries are awesome -- crispy, thick, and tender. Every fry was perfect. Kudos to the chef. No more driving to Flemington for burgers. Nice to have another great choice for dinner in Clinton! (The service is friendly and quick, and the joint is clean and comfortable.) We'll be back, and we're bringing friends.",Positive
128,0.9325,Great food greater service. Johnny is an excellent chef and owner. His hospitality cannot be beat and neither can his food. The prices are extremely reasonable. If your looking for a place to take your family and have an excellent dinner Johnny's Place is the place to go.,Positive
129,-0.0387,"My wife, who is 8 months pregnant, came home in tears after her experience at this pitiful restaurant. Apparantly the owner felt it necessary to hover over her and my 2 year old son while she tried to have a nice meal. Add the fact that the food is sub-par, and I am hopefully awaiting the next change in ownership.",Neutral
130,0.4628,"Food isn't bad. However, the place is not kid friendly at all. Bring a straight jacket for your toddlers or be prepared to be yelled at by the owner every 2 minutes.",Positive
131,-0.9561,"Food was okay. But the lady behind the counter spoke poor English and when I received my food it was cold to the bone. The owner had a not so kind attitude that made the experience a little nerve racking. I also did not feel safe with the local drunk loitering outside trying to play a game of grab ass with me. I was not amused. Overall, the place is clean and the establishment looks better then the food tastes. My hamburger bun couldn't have been anymore moist if they tried. The fries resulted in me having a bad case of the salty squirts which scorched my anus upon exit.",Negative
132,0.6114,I tried this place a couple weeks ago. Got the sausage and broccoli rabe sandwich. It was delicious!,Positive
133,0.8999,"Johnny's place sets the standard in Clinton. This joint out shines every surrounding restaurant in the area. It's a true pleasure to have a real Italian hotdog, a meatball parm you can't tell your mother about, and a burger that melts in your mouth. Johnny's is the real deal! Your not just ordering a burger, your ordering heart and soul.",Positive
134,0.9128,"Meh. It was just ok. I've had better hot dogs, better chicken fingers, definitely had better fried pickles. Upside? It wasn't terrible.",Positive
135,0.0,"My wife and I stopped in the other night and had dinner prepared by Johnny. She had the eggplant rollatini , and I had to Seafood fra Diablo . Johnny Is an incredible cook . Looking forward to my next meal from here .",Neutral
136,0.9656,"Someone told me that the other place closed and is now Johnny's. I stopped in and got a meatball sub to go. Sorry no picture, I devoured it. It was pretty good. So I walked in and it was quiet at 6:30 on a Wednesday. Glad to see they have non high fruitcose beverage offerings, saw some Coke from Mexico and Fanta. Nice to see they remodeled the interior and ditched the picnic tables. Still wrapping my head around this burger joint with Italian offerings. I'll be back, nice selection and reasonable prices. A nice addition to the casual dining offerings in Clinton, Good Luck!!",Positive
137,0.8775,Husband picked up the eggplant parm sub and meatball sub. The bread is really delicious! Eggplant was thinly sliced and nicely seasoned. Meatballs were tasty. Sandwiches have a good amount of sauce and cheese.,Positive
138,0.8932,"Strolled in on a cold night to pick up an Italian hot dog. It was ready after a short wait (under 10 minutes) Hot dog was tasty and topped with peppers, onions and thinly sliced fried potatoes. Served in long loaf of fresh Italian bread (so good!) It was a delicious meal that really hit the spot. Looking forward to trying more of the menu.",Positive
